# ToggleSwitch
This project is a simple yet powerful GUI-based toggle switch application built using Python and Tkinter. It offers a user-friendly interface with several advanced features. The toggle button allows users to switch between ON and OFF states, accompanied by a sound effect (on Windows systems) for feedback. A built-in auto-off timer automatically turns the switch off after 10 seconds to simulate timeout functionality. The interface supports dark mode, letting users switch between light and dark themes seamlessly. A reset button clears the toggle count and restores the default state, while real-time timestamp updates show when the switch was last toggled. The app also tracks the number of toggles, and every action is recorded in a toggle_log.txt file for logging purposes. Additionally, an Exit button is provided for a clean and graceful shutdown of the application. Overall, this project is a great demonstration of interactive GUI development in Python with practical features and customization options.
